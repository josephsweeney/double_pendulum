# Presentation

* We accurately modelled a double pendulum system.
* We started by modelling a single pendulum system. Then attaching another pendulum  onto the end of it.
* Then we actually figured out the equations of motion of the system.
  * Talk about the variables that come into play
* We implemented the runge kutta algorithm to approximate the solution to the differential equation.
  * This involved changing the form of the diff eq to be in terms of the angular velocity instead of the angle.
  * The Runge Kutta method outputs the next state of the system given a certain time differential.



* Then talk about the first demo where you can control the angles of the pendulums.

* Talk about how it is a chaotic system, then show the second demo
